                    If you have a 25% chance of getting a metallic in 1 day, you do <strong>not</strong> have a 50% chance of getting one over 2 days, and a 100% chance of getting 1 in 4 days.<br/>
                    You actually have closer to a 44% chance over 2 days, and a 68% chance over 4 days!<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Think of it like this: The odds of flipping a coin and it landing on heads is 50%, however if you flip a coin twice, you are not guaranteed to get heads any of those times! This is because the odds reset back to 50% every time you flip it."></app-result>
